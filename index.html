   <ol> <li><p>Last night
        Feeling a bit low<br>
        
      <strong> I was going paranoid</strong>, fully exhausted.<br>
        
       An empty soul was there, 
        I feel numb, like there was nothing around.<br>
        
        Imagining the spirits around me, 
        Taking me for a deep sleep. <br>
        
        I was drowning in my own thoughts, 
        There was darkness all around. 
        Monsters ruling all over my town. <br>
        
        Fighting with my own dark side, 
        Can't take it anymore. <br>
        
        <strong>I'm going paranoid</strong>, fully exhausted</p></li>
       <li> <p> These days living my best life,
            Enjoying every moment of today, 
            But sometimes thinking about tomorrow's morning vibe.<br>
            
            Preparing hard for exams, 
            But sometimes thinking about the failure side. <br>
            
            Feeling sad tonight, 
            But sometimes thinking about the next fight. <br>
            
            Going to my city, 
            But sometimes thinking about the return time. <br>
        </p></li></ol>
